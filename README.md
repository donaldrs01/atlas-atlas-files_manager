The files manager project is a culmination of several of the core concepts of our fourth trimsester at Atlas. It creates an API that handles the uploading, saving and retrie.val of different file types. It then handles connections to both Redis, which handles user session and authentication data in-memory for quick access, and MongoDB as our database for file storage. The final product is a secure and persistent file management system.

Our tech stack for this project includes:
Node.js
Express
MongoDB
Redis
JavaScript
